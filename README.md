# C-project

# Details
ğŸ‘‰The snake is represented with a 0(zero) symbol.
ğŸ‘‰The fruit is represented with an F symbol.
ğŸ‘‰The snake can move in any direction according to the user with the help of the keyboard (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys).
ğŸ‘‰When the snake eats a fruit the score will increase.
ğŸ‘‰The fruit will generate automatically within the boundaries.
ğŸ‘‰Whenever the snake touches the boundary the game is over.

# A few more details
There will be four user-defined functions. The user-defined functions created in this program are given below:
ğŸ‘‰Draw(): This function creates the boundary in which the game will be played.
ğŸ‘‰Setup(): This function will set the position of the fruit within the boundary.
ğŸ‘‰Input(): This function will take the input from the keyboard.
ğŸ‘‰Logic(): This function will set the snake's movement.

# Happy Coding.
